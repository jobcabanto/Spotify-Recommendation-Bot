# Spotify-Playlist-Analyzing-Bot

The goal of the project was to quantify my music taste and understand my listening patterns from a numerical point of view. The playlist analyzing bot reads into playlists with songs I've never heard of before and uses machine learning to predict whether I'd enjoy a song or not.

Tools/Technologies Used:
- Python
- SQL (SQLite)
- Spotify API

Data Parameters:
- Comparisons are strictly made with the "Discover Weekly" playlist
- "Discover Weekly" playlists can be compared with any playlist created by myself to help with genre consistency
- K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm was applied to predict songs of liking and disliking
