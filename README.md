# Spotify-Recommendation-Bot

The goal of the project was to read into playlists with songs I've never heard of before and use machine learning to predict whether I'd enjoy a song or not.

Used the Spotify API to pull my music, an SQL database to store music for easier access, and the scikit-learn library for machine learning.
