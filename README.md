# Spotify-Playlist-Analyzing-Bot

The goal of the project was to quantify my music taste and understand my listening patterns from a numerical perspective. The playlist analyzing bot reads into playlists with songs I've never heard of before and uses machine learning to predict whether I'd enjoy a song or not.

Used the Spotify API to pull my music, an SQL database to store music for easier access, and the scikit-learn library for machine learning.
